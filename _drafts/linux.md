I grew up a Windows 95 child.  Once upon a time, I knew its Start Menu and
Control Panel so well, I could probably have navigated them blindfolded.  As my
childhood progressed, we remained a Windows family, slowly upgrading through XP,
Vista, and 7.  I was the type of kid in early high school who trumpeted the
superiority of Windows and the unworthiness of Mac OS -- despite never having
used a Mac other than the outdated school computers.  My first programming
language was Microsoft's very own C#, back when the latest IDE for it was Visual
Studio 2005 Express Edition.  In short, I was a PC snob with no experience with
anything else.

I look back on those days with a healthy dose of chagrin.  I believed that there
was somehow an objective measure by which Windows was better than any other
choice, for everyone.  Now I've come to realize that no such measure exists.
Windows is a great OS, but so are Mac OS and the great variety of Linuxes.  The
question "which is best?" is the wrong one.  It should be "which is best for
me?"  Since the beginning of college, I've learned that the answer to that
question, for me, is Linux.
