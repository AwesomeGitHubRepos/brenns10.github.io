Stephen is a friendly Leo who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the
rain.
*... wait, that's the wrong biosketch!*

I'm a student entering my fifth year at [CWRU](https://case.edu), where I'm
pursuing a BS and MS in Computer Science. While at school, I've been an active
member of [HacSoc](http://hacsoc.org), a computing interest group.

I've been programming for eight years now *(whaaat?)*, with my current languages
of choice being Python and C. I really like doing little [projects](/projects/)
in my spare time, and writing [blog posts](/blog/) when inspiration strikes.

Beyond all that, I like cooking, piano, *How I Met Your Mother*, Emacs, and the
color green.  In case you were wondering, I *do* in fact like piña coladas, but
not so much getting caught in the rain.

If you have time, check out [what I'm doing now (ish)](/now/) and my
[links](/links/).
