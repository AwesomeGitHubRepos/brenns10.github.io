Hello, everyone!  This is the inaugural post on the blog for my new personal
website.  This blog isn't intended to be a frequently updated chronicle of my
life, or filled with memes and cat pictures.  You can expect it to contain my
occasional thoughts on computer topics, posts about my personal programming
projects, and also any neat tips and tricks I feel worthy of sharing with the
world.  I hope everyone enjoys it.  Please let me know what you think in the
comments!
