title: Python and Pie!

Every year at the end of freshman orientation, incoming CWRU students get to
attend a "Saturday College" (SatCo) of their choice.  They are opportunities to
learn something new and exciting before getting into the daily grind of "real
classes".  Student organizations have historically led their own SatCos to
advertise themselves to the incoming freshmen.  Today, Hacker's Society led our
very own SatCo, Python and Pie!

[Andrew Mason](ajm188.github.io) and I co-taught a sparse (but experienced)
group of freshmen the basics of Python, and moved on to showing them one cool
use of Python: writing a Twitter bot!  We even moved on and discussed how Python
can be used to do web scraping and efficiently compute factorials.  All of this
as we shared 16 delicious pies provided generously by Hacker's Society!

If you missed it, you can see the code for my example Twitter bot,
[@pypie15bot](https://twitter.com/pypie15bot), at
[github](https://github.com/brenns10/pypie15int) (complete with a brief
tutorial). Its depressing existence consists of waiting to be tweeted at, and
once it has been, replying back with a randomly chosen Taylor Swift lyric.  You
can also see the module I wrote to download all of Taylor Swift's (or any other
artist's) lyrics [here](https://github.com/brenns10/tswift).  It's also
available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tswift) -- just run `pip
install tswift`!
