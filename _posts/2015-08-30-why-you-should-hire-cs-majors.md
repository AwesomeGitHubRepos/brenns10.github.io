This morning my parents forwarded me an [article][] in the Wall Street Journal,
entitled "Why I'm Not Looking to Hire Computer-Science Majors," by Daniel
Gelernter (CEO of a startup called [Dittach][]).  It was an interesting read,
but one that I ultimately disagreed with, enough to write about it here on my
blog.  Unfortunately, the article is behind a paywall, so you can't read it
without a subscription.  Here is a brief summary of the main points
Mr. Gelernter made:

* Startups have difficulty competing with major companies for skilled,
  passionate developers.  Google and Facebook (for instance) can offer vast
  salaries, benefits, and stock options that startups can't match.
* Mr. Gelernter prefers to look for developers with a "longtime love of coding"
  instead of those who learned to code at a 12 week "boot camp" and are looking
  for a career transition.
* Mr. Gelernter doesn't look for computer science majors, because schools don't
  teach them what he values in a developer.
    * The teaching is "10 years behind in a field that changes every 10
      minutes."
    * The courses focus on things he considers irrelevant (like operating system
      design) without providing experience with working on real development
      teams.
    * There are few courses on practical skills like mobile app development.
* Mr. Gelernter believes that there is room for an alternative way of training
  software developers that focuses on teaching students "the skills that
  startups are desperate for, and that universities couldn't care less about."

Most of my disagreement stems from his opinion on computer science education,
but I think I have to comment on each of these points, starting with his second
one.

## Longtime coding lovers

I think I have to agree that people with the "longtime love of coding" are much
better candidates for software development jobs.  Being the humble author of
this article, I would probably put myself under that category: I started
programming (in C#) the summer before high school, and got experience in
programming with at least three other programming languages (Java, Python, and
PHP) before starting college.  I genuinely couldn't (and still can't) get enough
of coding.

As I go through college, I'm starting to learn to distinguish who else is
infected by this "coding love", and who is here because they thought they could
get a good job with a degree in CS.  You can tell by their behavior.  The former
group spends time working on little side projects.  If they're like me, they'll
readily gush to you about how cool the last thing they made was.  They take time
in their school schedules to learn new programming languages.  They read and
discuss news sites like [Hacker News][HN] that keep them up-to-date with new
technologies and cool ideas.  The latter group knows our CS curriculum's
programming language (currently Java) but probably hasn't taken the time to
learn any others.  They might not be very familiar with major software
development tools (such as version control systems).  They may not even have a
firm grasp on the basics of what happens when you navigate to a website in your
web browser.  More important than a lack of knowledge is a lack of drive to
learn more!

This isn't just seeing people at different stages in their education.  This is a
difference in attitude!  There are plenty of passionate coders at my school who
don't have much experience or knowledge yet.  While they may not know everything
I just mentioned, they spend time learning from their classmates that do.  Our
campus is lucky enough to have an extremely active organization called
[Hacker Society][hacsoc] that exists to bring people with these passions
together, so we can learn from one another.

## The computer science curriculum

If our school needs a "Hacker Society" of students to teach each other all of
this stuff, where does our curriculum come in?  Why don't we just form our own
group, teach each other, and save *bundles* of money?  Despite the skimpy
coverage of iOS and Android development in our curriculum, we do learn very
valuable things.  We don't talk very much about computer science theory at
Hacker Society, but it still underlies what we do, and we need our classes to
teach it.  Without getting into the depths of computer science, let me explain
what I mean.

The computer science curriculum gives us a lens for looking at problems.  By
studying it, we understand the tradeoffs of the world we work in.  We understand
that we can write programs that run quickly, but need lots of space, or we can
write ones that need little space, but run slower.  You can't get something for
nothing, and understanding these tradeoffs is frequently the heart of solving a
programming problem, especially when the tradeoffs have real meaning in a
software project.

The computer science curriculum teaches us how to use the things we need the
most.  Sure, as Mr. Gelernter pointed out, understanding how to design an
operating system probably isn't a skill I'll directly apply.  But the vast
majority of code a developer writes runs on an operating system, and if they
don't understand the basics of how it works and what it does, they're writing
code on a rotten foundation.  You expect that an engineer building a bridge
understands the properties of the ground they're building on, and the materials
they're using.  For programmers, the operating system is that ground and
material.

In computer science, we learn a disciplined mental model that makes the
"passionate coder" a better developer.  It's about the transferable skills, not
the particular technologies.  Imagine I went to college, say, eight years ago.
In 2007, the first generation iPhone was released.  That marked the beginning of
what I think of fondly as "Apple's war against Flash."  Tons of websites had
these "flashy" (pun *definitely* intended) plugins that ran on Adobe's Flash
Player.  They featured lots of pretty transitions and animations.  But the
iPhone didn't have Flash, and Apple threw its weight behind HTML5 and apps.
Fast-forward to today, and Flash is [on its way out][flash].

If I went to college then, and it was the way Mr. Gelernter would have it, I
would have learned the ins and outs of Adobe Flash, so I could make killer Flash
websites that made companies look professional and sleek.  And today, I would be
out of a job, because Flash is vulnerable, not mobile friendly, and the industry
moved on.  I would be stuck having to relearn everything I learned in college,
but in HTML5 or native app development.  And you know what?  Give it another
eight years and we'll probably be doing something new.  At least with a computer
science degree (as it is now), I'll always have the core mental model, and I'll
just need to learn new tools and paradigms as they appear.

## Startup skills

For a startup that needs skilled developers to help bring a vision into reality,
it totally makes sense that you want a developer who already knows the practical
toolset you want to use.  We try to learn those toolsets and other cool things
at our school's [Hacker Society][hacsoc], but not everyone has the benefit of
such an organization.  A big tech company probably can look beyond the toolsets
their candidates know, and try to hire the ones who learned to solve problems
exceptionally in school.  Maybe that's why they can so easily steal developers
from startups.  Sure, lots of money and stock options are probably the main
reason, but I know I'd feel better if I knew a company wanted me for my computer
science and problem solving skills rather than because I know their toolset!

## The ideal learning environment

So, do we need to stop expecting software developers to get a computer science
degree?  If you ask me, no!  College computer science education is not too far
from where it needs to be, even if it isn't perfect.  Instead of figuring out
some new way to train software developers, we should focus on more excellent
student organizations like [Hacker Society][hacsoc].  We focus on bringing out
the passion in our members and helping them learn the practical tools they may
need to know.  The combination of a student organization like this and a
theoretical education is potent, and it has already produced several alumni that
are headed to bright careers.  We'd love to see this sort of organization
becoming more common in the world of EECS education!

If you're interested in hearing more about this organization, the
[website][hacsoc] may be of interest, as well as our [ACM/IEEE][acm] chapter
(which is part of Hacker Society).  We host an annual conference called
[Link-State][ls], which you may be interested in attending, [speaking][] at, or
[sponsoring][].  (And that's the end of that plug.)

## Conclusion

I definitely don't mean to say that being self taught makes you a bad candidate
for a job.  Self teaching got me very far before I came to college.  Good
candidates come from everywhere, and you don't have to be ruling people out
either way.  That being said, I do think that a computer science program in
combination with the genuine hacker spirit is the most effective way to produce
the best developers.
