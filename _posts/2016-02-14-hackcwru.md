description: HackCWRU 2016 (our biggest hackathon yet) was a great success!
---

[HackCWRU 2016](hack.cwru.edu) has finally come and gone.  I'm up late, since
staying up for 30+ hours kind of messed with my sleep schedule.  This year, we
had over 500 people sign up, and around 180 people in attendance (but citations
are really needed here - I don't have the official counts).  I had a ton of fun,
and there's a lot to say about the good times had at HackCWRU 2016.  But, I
think those have already been written very well by Andrew Mason in his
[wrap-up blog post](http://www.fixedpoint.xyz/blog/hack-cwru-16-wrap-up/).  So,
go read that instead of reading a blog post by me!
