description: I've updated my domain!
---

Regular visitors to my site (if there are any!) may have noticed that, starting
today, `stephen-brennan.com` is redirecting to a new domain name, `brennan.io`.
This change was motivated by a few reasons:

1. Long domain names are unwieldy!  `stephen-brennan.com` is 19 characters
   long.  Put that in an email address (like `stephen@stephen-brennan.com`) and
   you have a very long and somewhat difficult to use address.  Compare that to
   `brennan.io`, which is 10 characters, and `stephen@brennan.io`, which is 18
   -- fewer characters than the original domain!
2. I didn't like the hyphenated domain!  I originally wanted to have
   `stephenbrennan.com`, but that domain was (and still is) already taken, so I
   went with the hyphenated one, which I didn't like too much.  Now I finally
   have taken the time to get rid of the hyphen.
3. The top-level domain `.io` has been a somewhat popular one as of late,
   especially among tech-related sites.  I suspect that the popularity has to do
   with two things.  First, with the surge of new TLDs such as `.tech` and
   `.site`, which both seem rather silly and untrustworthy, older and less
   verbose TLDs such as `.io` seem more normal and trustworthy.  Second, the
   abbreviation I/O (for input/output) suggests computing and technology.  Since
   I mainly use this site to write about those topics, this choice of TLD makes
   sense.
4. Finally, using just my last name gives me the opportunity to create
   subdomains and email addresses for family members, should they want a
   personal site or email address.
   
So, please update any bookmark or links you may have.  I plan on having
`stephen-brennan.com` around for a while, since there are already a lot of links
to my site around the Internet.  All links to `stephen-brennan.com` will simply
redirect to their corresponding targets here on `brennan.io`.  Hopefully in the
next few days, search engines will pick up on the change and update their
rankings accordingly!
