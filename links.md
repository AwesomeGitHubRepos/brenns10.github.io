# Links

In no particular order, a list of things that I found helpful in learning the
things I know today. Hopefully, somebody else may find them useful in their own
education.

- [Unicode and character sets][joel-unicode]. This is, like, super important.
- [Comparing Floating Point Numbers][float].  This article series was pivotal in
  me learning what floating point numbers even are, let alone how to compare
  them.
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming][beej].  A truly wonderful resource for
  learning networking.  It's based on C, but the Socket API is pretty consistent
  everywhere (especially in Python).
- [Intro to MIPS Assembly][mips].  Although I later learned this in EECS 314
  (Computer Architecture), I first learned MIPS assembly from this great guide.
- [Implementing Regular Expressions][regex]: A series of articles by Russ Cox. I
  consider this to be some of the best practical information out there about
  implementing regular expressions, that is still firmly rooted in theory.
- [Python Challenge][py-chal].  This is an excellent puzzle/riddle set for
  Python programmers.
- [TI-Basic Developer][tibasicdev].  At one point, this was one of my main
  programming resources!  Of course, it was for a graphing calculator.

Some books I recommend:

- [The C Programming Language][knr] by Kernighan & Ritchie (of course)
- [Linux Kernel Development, 3rd Edition][lkd] by Robert Love
- [Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition][unix] by John Lions. This contains the
  complete source code for the UNIX operating system (well, the kernel) and a
  commentary of the whole darn thing. At only 9000 lines of C, I've seen (and
  probably written) many CRUD webapps with more code than UNIX had. I haven't
  had the time to fully read this, but it's on my to-do list.

I've developed a real appreciation for blogging, both writing my own and reading
those of my friends. So here is a
whole [directory](http://hacsoc.org/wiki/directory) of blogs from my friends
at [HacSoc](http://hacsoc.org) you should check out!
