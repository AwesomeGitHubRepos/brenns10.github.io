Like you may have seen on my front page, I'm pretty heavily involved in
[Hacker Society][hacsoc], a campus computing interest group.  Every fall we host
[Link-State][], a (really awesome) tech conference.  Shoot [us][officers] a
message if you want to give a talk there or sponsor the conference!  Every
spring, we also host [HackCWRU][], a hackathon.  Again, shoot [us][officers] an
email if you're interested in sponsoring (or even co-hosting) the event!

Some other miscellaneous HacSoc links:

I've developed a real appreciation for blogging, both writing my own and reading
those of my friends.  So here is a whole
[directory](http://hacsoc.org/wiki/directory) of blogs you should check out!

And now, in no particular order, a list of things that I found helpful in
learning the things I know today.  Hopefully, somebody else may find them useful
in their own education.

- [Unicode and character sets][joel-unicode]. This is, like, super important.
- [Comparing Floating Point Numbers][float].  This article series was pivotal in
  me learning what floating point numbers even are, let alone how to compare
  them.
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming][beej].  A truly wonderful resource for
  learning networking.  It's based on C, but the Socket API is pretty consistent
  everywhere (especially in Python).
- [Intro to MIPS Assembly][mips].  Although I later learned this in EECS 314
  (Computer Architecture), I first learned MIPS assembly from this great guide.
- [Python Challenge][py-chal].  This is an excellent puzzle/riddle set for
  Python programmers.
- [TI-Basic Developer][tibasicdev].  At one point, this was one of my main
  programming resources!  Of course, it was for a graphing calculator.
