# /now/

#### Last Updated: March 15, 2016

I'm working on the second second semester of my fourth year at CWRU.  My courses
this semester are Data Mining and a special topics course on Internet Security
this semester, as well as a really enjoyable film class, and psychology.

I've had a few toy projects croup up recently, as well as continued development
on some longer running ones.  I updated
[libstephen](https://github.com/brenns10/libstephen) with my new regex
implementation, while at the same time fixing a few issues with it.  I also
added more robust assertions in the unit testing portion of the library.  As for
the toy projects, I recently implemented a quick and dirty (but very practical
and deployed) implementation of
[SlackBot for GroupMe](https://github.com/brenns10/groupme-slackbot).
Additionally, I made a neat script for Slack that monitors RSS feeds for
updates, and then posts them to a channel - check it out
[here](https://github.com/hacsoc/blognotifier).

In other news, I'm still very excited to spend my next summer working as an
intern at Yelp in San Francisco, in their spam department!  I've found housing
with some great fellow CWRU students who are also interning at Yelp, and my
start date is inching ever closer!
