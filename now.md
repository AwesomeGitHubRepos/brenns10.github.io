# /now/

#### Last Updated: May 8, 2016

I just finished my fourth year at CWRU, which means I'm no longer *just* a
senior; I'm a *super* senior!  Which is OK, because I'm getting a Master's
degree next year (fingers crossed).

I'll be starting at Yelp in the Spam department on May 23, which is inching ever
closer!
