#### Last Updated: December 16, 2015

I'm currently finished with the second semester of my fourth year at CWRU!  My
classes were Advanced Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering.
I'm excited to be taking Data Mining and Analysis of Algorithms next semester.

Looking forward to winter break \o/

Hacking on some rather fun projects - most recently
[NOSJ](https://github.com/brenns10/nosj).

Planning [HackCWRU 2016](http://hack.cwru.edu) with HacSoc exec.  The official
date is February 12-14!

Getting excited to go to Glendale, Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl!  Go OSU!

Getting **super** hyped to spend my next summer working as an intern at Yelp in
San Francisco, in their *spam department*!
