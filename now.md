# /now/
#### Last Updated: January 7, 2016

I'm currently finished with the second semester of my fourth year at CWRU!  My
main classes were Advanced Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Software
Engineering.  I'm excited to be taking Data Mining and a special course on
Internet Security in the spring semester.

Hacking on some rather fun projects - most recently
[NOSJ](https://github.com/brenns10/nosj).

Planning [HackCWRU 2016](http://hack.cwru.edu) with HacSoc exec.  The official
date is February 12-14!

Getting **super** hyped to spend my next summer working as an intern at Yelp in
San Francisco, in their *spam department*!
