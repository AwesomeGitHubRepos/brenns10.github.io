# /now/

#### Last Updated: February 15, 2016

I'm working on the second second semester of my fourth year at CWRU.  My courses
this semester are Data Mining and a special topics course on Internet Security
this semester, as well as a really enjoyable film class, and psychology.

Lately my programming projects have been focused on regular expressions.  I've
been working on an alternative regex implementation for my C library (check it
out [here](https://github.com/brenns10/regex)).  In parallel, I'm porting that
implementation to Javascript.  I'm hoping to add visualization features to help
people learn more about regular expressions and their implementation.

On February 12-14, we held [HackCWRU 2016](hack.cwru.edu)!  This was HacSoc's
biggest HackCWRU ever, and I was glad to be a part of it.

Getting **super** hyped to spend my next summer working as an intern at Yelp in
San Francisco, in their spam department!
