As of August 12 I have finished a really awesome internship at Yelp, with the
spam team! The team was responsible for making the experience so great: they're
all really nice and very smart---a pleasure to work with. Thanks to them I got
the opportunity to work on a wide variety of hard problems, like fighting credit
card fraud and detecting spammy and dangerous URLs.

This fall I'm Cleveland bound for my fifth and final year of school at CWRU. If
everything goes as planned, I'll be graduating in the spring with a Bachelor's
and Master's degree. Also on my plate for the fall is planning [Link-State][],
an annual technology conference at my school.

In the world of interesting projects, I've been spending some free time working
on a simple lisp implementation, this time using mark and sweep garbage
collection. It currently resides within [libstephen][], so check it out if you
have a chance.
