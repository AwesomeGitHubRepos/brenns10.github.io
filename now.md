# /now/

#### Last Updated: July 24, 2016

I'm currently nearing the end of my internship in the Spam team at Yelp, which
I've spent doing some very cool stuff including fraud prevention and URL spam
detection. I also had the chance to participate in the Yelp Hackathon, and
[this]({% post_url 2016-07-23-bart-fare-hacking %}) was the product of my labor!

I just finished my fourth year at CWRU, which means I'm no longer *just* a
senior; I'm a *super* senior!  Which is OK, because I'm getting a Master's
degree next year (fingers crossed).
