# /now/

#### Last Updated: Feb 29, 2024

##### Work

Working at Oracle on the Linux Sustaining Engineering team. I get to work on
resolving complex customer bugs (e.g. panics) and performance issues involving
the Linux kernel. I typically handle core kernel bugs, especially those
involving the VFS & printk. In addition, I get to work on great tools.

I'm very proud of the current projects I get to work on with Oracle:

- I regularly contribute new features to
  [drgn](https://github.com/osandov/drgn), including an in-progress series of
  changes which enable kernel debugging without huge "debuginfo" packages.
- I author & maintain a [CLI](https://github.com/oracle/yo/) for managing OCI
  cloud instances. It's used pretty heavily internally by my team, with well
  over 100 users.

##### Interests

Obviously, given my work, I'm really interested in debuggers, debugging tools,
and the data formats we use to make everything go together. I'm also interested
in most other kernel stuff, though it's beyond impossible to keep up.

Outside of these, I've been interested in things that make my life nicer without
depending on centralized systems - decentralized social media and self-hosted
tools being two big examples.

And outside of tech, I'm a pretty major Trekkie & Swiftie.
