#### Last Updated: November 24, 2016

I'm working through my fifth year of school to complete my bachelor's and
master's degrees in computer science. My master's thesis involves kernel
development, and so I've been writing a lot about that in my blog. Some
interesting things I've been working on are [DPath][] and [KChat][]

As of August 12 I have finished a really awesome internship at Yelp, with the
spam team! The team was responsible for making the experience so great: they're
all really nice and very smart---a pleasure to work with. Thanks to them I got
the opportunity to work on a wide variety of hard problems, like fighting credit
card fraud and detecting spammy and dangerous URLs.
